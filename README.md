# 🚀 MyCSharpJourney

Hello! 👋  
This repository contains **basic and intermediate-level console applications** developed as part of my journey to learn C#.  
Every line of code reflects my desire to practice and my excitement to explore the world of software development.

---

## 🎯 My Goal

My goal is not just to learn C#, but also to apply it through **clean architecture**, **readable**, and **maintainable code**. Through these projects, I aim to:

- 🤖 Strengthen algorithmic thinking  
- 🛠️ Focus on code quality and documentation  
- 🔍 Pay attention to details and improve user experience  
- ✨ Share knowledge and exchange ideas with other learners  

---

## 🧭 Learning Path

Each project is designed to put a new concept into practice:

- Core C# features like `enum`, `exception`, `access modifier`
- Applying software principles such as `DRY` and `SRP`
- Input validation and error handling in console applications
- Professional presentation and version control on GitHub

> I know there may be imperfections in the code — I'm still a student on this path.  
> Constructive feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 🧠💬
